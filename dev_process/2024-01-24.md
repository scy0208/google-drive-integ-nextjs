# Give cursor.ai question on requirement change
@google-drive.tsx Update the code, Instead of directly fetch and render image in UI, I have create a folder under `public/images`, fetchImageFromDrive should fetch the image and download it to the folder, UI should render every image under this folder (actively render for changes in the folder).
